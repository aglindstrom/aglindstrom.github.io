	<h1> Hello World! </h1>
	<p> My name is Andrew Lindstrom, and I would like to thank you for enjoying my site. Creating things, wether digital or physical, has always been a joy in my life. By the time I was five I had Legos and Lego creations covering my floor. I was slowly introduced to the programming world when I recieved my first Lego Mindstrom. A friend and I would spend long nights determining how to build cars, helicopters, and robots that walk up to you and shake your hand. As my love for all things programming began to evolve I found my way to html and css. In combination with eachother these two languages have allowed me to combine programming with the artistic side of creation. Along side programming and engineering I have always loved art. I would spend long hours drawing pictures of people, cars, and cartoons. I filled many notebooks with pages of different things, or sometimes many of the same thing trying to get the details right. As my programming mind was drawn to the computer so was my artistic mind. I slowly became involved with 3d art using the Blender 3d modeling package. After almost exclusively using Blender for a year or two I decided I needed to start making digital paintings and drawings. This lead to me purchasing the Wacom Cintiq I use for drawing and texture creation. I plan to continue in the direction I came from and web design allows me to do that. </p>
