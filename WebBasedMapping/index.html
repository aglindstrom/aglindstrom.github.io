						<h1> The Life of a Program </h1>
						<p> There are many things to know about a program before starting. What is the function, how will it accomplish this function, and where do I start are some of many questions to ask before delving into the mind wrending code. Even if all these questions are answered the code will break and fail due to some unknown underlying cause. Many programs that we use are rigorously tested before put on the market and even then the programs still break when we use them. <br/>
						The program I have written is in a stage known as <em>alpha</em>. this stage is still very unstable and will crash far more than any program you or I would use in our day to day lives. The next phase of the program creation processes is known as <em>beta</em>. Many companies release their software to the public during beta for testing. The program will still most likely have many <em>bugs</em>. The developer releases their software in this state to get feed back on bugs. Having a million testers is much better than the number a developer could fit in their office. After the beta testing is complete the developer ships their product. This can be a carried out by using a storage devices or through an internet download. </p>
